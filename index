              <h1>Overview</h1>
              <p>I'm a graduate student at Kent state University. I enjoy reading News paper, reading bookd of fictional kind, and I'm passionate about computer science.</p>

              <h1>Education</h1>
              <p>In July 2015, I enrolled in a 6-year Integrated Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and
                Electronics Engineering, Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies-BASAR, which
                allowed me to gain hands-on experience and practical knowledge on few courses namely
                Microprocessors and Microcontrollers, Electronic Circuits, Power Electronics, Linear Control
                Systems Engineering, Power Systems, Network Theory under the graduation program of which
                the last two are my favorite.</p>

            <section id="Work Experience" class mt-4>
              <h1>Work Experience</h1>
              <p class="text-muted"></p>
              <p>In March 2020, I joined Tata Consultancy Services as System Engineer, working in a
                functional testing team. In this position, I am entrusted to look after the testing phase of the
                software development process to ensure the final product meets the organization's quality
                standards. Here, I got an opportunity to constantly engage with clients to understand their
                requirements and thereby assist the team in achieving the desired outcome. Since it was my first
                full-time position, initially, I faced certain challenges, as starting a career in a fast-paced
                organization like ours with short sprints is quite challenging. But I quickly adapted, and through
                teamwork, and learned the required skills for which I received appreciation from my peers and
                mentors. All these experiences have crafted me as a better individual with a lot of enlivening
                spirit to realize my dreams and develop a well-rounded personality..</p>

            <section id="Co-Curricular Activities" class mt-4>
              <h1>Co-Curricular Activities</h1>
              <p>With a zeal to develop my overall personality, I ensured to participate in co-curricular activities
                right from my school years. I hold the prestigious National Cadet Corps 'A' Grade Certificate. I
                learnt unity, discipline, leadership, and teamwork by being a part of NCC. During under
                graduation, with my leadership skills, I was elected to be a founding member of Student
                Governing Council, RGUKT-Basar, through these I strengthened the council by organizing
                various counselling programs on prevention of Ragging and Eve-Teasing for the well-being of
                the student's community.</p>
